The night they found out
You ignored the king's command you laughed
On top of a hill you can touch the aurora from
You invited me with open arms
 
"It's pretty isn't it" you said looking at a dirty, loose bead
Then you gave it the night sky as a present
 
A clown never shows their true face
And just like a joke, you disappeared on that day
 
Today too, the world spins effortlessly
But that speed is enough to dry tears
 
The one that grants your wish
Is you, not anyone else
Picking a day with a strong wind
You came running
 
Where are you and what are you doing now?
Your shining figure as you left floats into my head
I want to see you
 
The one that grants your wish
Is you, not anyone else
Picking a day with a strong wind
You came running
 
Even if you can't fly, you're not worried
Because the ground stretches on
Reaching a place that you love
If it's you, you can do it
